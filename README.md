### Capstone Projects: A Showcase of Data Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains the code and documentation for five data analysis projects completed during my internship at Utkarsh Minds. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with data, perform exploratory analysis, and communicate insights effectively.

### Project Overview

1. **Iris Flower Analysis:**
   * **Objective:** Explore and visualize the characteristics of iris flowers, identifying patterns and relationships between different species.

2. **Wine Quality Analysis:**
   * **Objective:** Analyze the factors influencing wine quality based on various physicochemical properties.

3. **Student Performance Analysis:**
   * **Objective:** Investigate the factors affecting student performance, such as gender, parental education, and test scores.

4. **Abalone Age Analysis:**
   * **Objective:** Explore the relationship between abalone age and its physical measurements.

5. **Heart Disease Risk Analysis:**
   * **Objective:** Identify risk factors associated with heart disease based on patient attributes.

**Note:** While these projects do not involve machine learning algorithms, they still demonstrate valuable data analysis skills, such as data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
